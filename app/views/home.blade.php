                    PGA is a science gateway built with the Airavata API. You can reference PGA as you integrate Airavata
                    into your own gateway, or you can create your gateway on top of PGA by cloning it at the link below.
                    PGA is known to work well in the Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer browsers.

                        create Science Gateways.

                        Apache Airavata is a software framework which is dominantly used to build Web-based science
                        gateways and assist to compose, manage, execute and monitor large scale applications and
                        workflows on distributed computing resources such as local clusters, supercomputers, national
                        grids, academic and commercial clouds. Airavata mainly supports long running applications and
                        workflows on distributed computational resources.
